# 📈 Kafka Stock Market Analysis

A real-time data pipeline project to analyze stock market data using **Apache Kafka** and the **AWS Cloud** ecosystem. This project showcases how to stream, store, transform, and query live data efficiently using various modern technologies.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end architecture of a real-time stock market data processing pipeline. Leveraging Kafka for data ingestion and several AWS services for data transformation and querying, it provides a powerful example of scalable, serverless analytics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Core Technologies

| Technology       | Purpose                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Apache Kafka** | Real-time data streaming and processing            |
| **AWS EC2**      | Hosted the Kafka Broker for data ingestion         |

### ☁️ AWS Cloud Services

| Service          | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon S3**    | Centralized data lake for storing raw and transformed data              |
| **AWS Glue**     | ETL service for processing and cleaning the streamed data               |
| **AWS Crawler**  | Automatically detects schema and creates table metadata in AWS Glue     |
| **AWS Athena**   | Serverless querying of data using SQL directly on S3                    |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Start Kafka Producer & Consumer**
   ```bash
   cd kafka_producer
   python producer.py
   cd ../kafka_consumer
   python consumer.py
   ```

2. **Ensure EC2 Instance with Kafka is Running**

3. **Verify Data in S3 Bucket**

4. **Run AWS Glue Job**

5. **Create AWS Glue Crawler & Run**

6. **Query with AWS Athena**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM stock_data_database.stock_table LIMIT 10;
   ```

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions for S3, Glue, Athena
- EC2 instance with Kafka set up
- Python 3.x
- Boto3 and Kafka Python libraries
